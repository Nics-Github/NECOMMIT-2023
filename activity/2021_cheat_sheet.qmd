## Introduction

This is the 2021 sqf cheat sheet for the 2023 NECOMMIT keynote given on Oct 21,2023.

Below you will find hints and code to mimic the data analysis we did with the sqf 2021 data. Hints are labeled **hints** and the optional code is folded so it cannot be seen until clicked. We will work in a RScript file.


## Setup

-   Go to [posit cloud](https://posit.cloud/) and set up an account.

-   Then click New RStudio Project ![](images/new-rstudio-project-02.png){width="200"} and give it a title.



## Install and Load

First we need to install the `tidyverse`. This is where our functions come from. Do this in the console pane.

```{r install-tidyverse}
#| code-fold: false
#| code-summary: "Install the tools we need"


install.packages("tidyverse")


```
## Open an RScript

-   File > New File > R Script
-   To run code in the R script you can highlight it and click ![](./images/Run.png) 
-   All of the following code will be entered into your RScript

## Load the libraries

```{r get-2011-data}
#| code-fold: false
#| code-summary: "Load the tools we need"

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

## Get the 2021 stop and frisk data

```{r get2021-data}
#| code-fold: false
#| code-summary: "Download and load and save the data"


url_2021 <- "https://www.nyc.gov/assets/nypd/downloads/excel/analysis_and_planning/stop-question-frisk/sqf-2021.xlsx"
download.file(url_2021, "sqf-2021.xlsx")
sqf_2021 <- read_excel("sqf-2021.xlsx")

# This line read the total number of rows for the document. 
#. The total number of rows is the total number of stops. 

total_stops <- nrow(sqf_2021)
```

## Now we can start. 

I'd like to the recreate the data analysis we did on paper for 2011 but in R. There are suggested next steps below. You can always copy code to your RScript.

## Recode your variables

This is probably the trickiest part:

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "recode to the race column"

#Recode Suspect_Race_Description to group hispanic

sqf_2021$SUSPECT_RACE_DESCRIPTION<-
  recode(
    sqf_2021$SUSPECT_RACE_DESCRIPTION,
    "BLACK HISPANIC" =	"Hispanic",
    "WHITE HISPANIC"	= "Hispanic",
    "BLACK"=	"Black",
    "WHITE"=	"White",
    "MIDDLE EASTERN/SOUTHWEST ASIAN"=	"MESA",
    "ASIAN / PACIFIC ISLANDER"=	"API",
    "AMERICAN INDIAN/ALASKAN NATIVE"=	"AMAN",
    "no data"=	"no data",
    .default = NA_character_
  )
```

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "recode to the race column"

# This will recode wether or not someone has been arrested. 1 is yes, 0 is no. 
#This will help us sum values later. 

sqf_2021$SUSPECT_ARRESTED_FLAG<-
  recode(
    sqf_2021$SUSPECT_ARRESTED_FLAG,
    "Y" =	1,
    "N"	= 0
  )
```

## Take a look at the data with `head(10)`

```{r}

sqf_2021 |>
  head(10)

# To see only the variable names you can  use 
sqf_2021 |>
  names() 


  
```

## Select the variables

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
# hint

**hint:** select() the variables we're interested `SUSPECT_RACE_DESCRIPTION` and `SUSPECT_REPORTED_AGE`
:::


```{r select21}
sqf_2021 |>
  select(SUSPECT_SEX, SUSPECT_RACE_DESCRIPTION, SUSPECT_REPORTED_AGE, SUSPECT_ARRESTED_FLAG)

```

## Rename the variables

`rename()` the variables to yell less (optional)

```{r name21}
sqf_2021 |>
  select(SUSPECT_SEX, SUSPECT_RACE_DESCRIPTION, SUSPECT_REPORTED_AGE, SUSPECT_ARRESTED_FLAG)|>
  rename("sex" = "SUSPECT_SEX",
         "race" = "SUSPECT_RACE_DESCRIPTION",
         "age" = "SUSPECT_REPORTED_AGE",
         "arrested" = "SUSPECT_ARRESTED_FLAG") 

```

## Tally up all of the stops by race.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
# hint

**hint:** `group_by(race)` and use `summarize()` to count all of the stops with `n()`.
:::

```{r stops_total }

sqf_2021 |>
  select(SUSPECT_SEX, SUSPECT_RACE_DESCRIPTION, SUSPECT_REPORTED_AGE, SUSPECT_ARRESTED_FLAG)|>
  rename("sex" = "SUSPECT_SEX",
         "race" = "SUSPECT_RACE_DESCRIPTION",
         "age" = "SUSPECT_REPORTED_AGE",
         "arrested" = "SUSPECT_ARRESTED_FLAG") |>
  group_by(race) |>
  summarise(stops_total=n())

```

## Find the percent stopped by race

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
# hint

**hint:** Add another variable maybe `percent_stopped` that find the proportion of total stops to `summarize()`. 
:::


```{r percent_stopped}

sqf_2021 |>
  select(SUSPECT_SEX, SUSPECT_RACE_DESCRIPTION, SUSPECT_REPORTED_AGE, SUSPECT_ARRESTED_FLAG)|>
  rename("sex" = "SUSPECT_SEX",
         "race" = "SUSPECT_RACE_DESCRIPTION",
         "age" = "SUSPECT_REPORTED_AGE",
         "arrested" = "SUSPECT_ARRESTED_FLAG") |>
  group_by(race) |>
  summarise(stops_by_race = n(),
            percent_stopped = n() / total_stops *100
  )

```

## Find the percent arrested

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
# hint

**hint:** Add a `percent_arrested` variable by adding to `summarize()`.
:::



```{r percent_arrested}

sqf_2021 |>
  select(SUSPECT_SEX, SUSPECT_RACE_DESCRIPTION, SUSPECT_REPORTED_AGE, SUSPECT_ARRESTED_FLAG)|>
  rename("sex" = "SUSPECT_SEX",
         "race" = "SUSPECT_RACE_DESCRIPTION",
         "age" = "SUSPECT_REPORTED_AGE",
         "arrested" = "SUSPECT_ARRESTED_FLAG") |>
  group_by(race) |>
  summarise(stops_by_race = n(),
            percent_stopped = n() / total_stops *100,
            percent_arrested = sum(arrested)/n() *100
  )

```

## Order the `percent_arrested` column

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
# hint

**hint:** `arrange()` the `percent_arrested` column so that they are in order.
:::



```{r arrange}

sqf_2021 |>
  select(SUSPECT_SEX, SUSPECT_RACE_DESCRIPTION, SUSPECT_REPORTED_AGE, SUSPECT_ARRESTED_FLAG)|>
  rename("sex" = "SUSPECT_SEX",
         "race" = "SUSPECT_RACE_DESCRIPTION",
         "age" = "SUSPECT_REPORTED_AGE",
         "arrested" = "SUSPECT_ARRESTED_FLAG") |>
  group_by(race) |>
  summarise(stops_by_race = n(),
            percent_stopped = n() / total_stops *100,
            percent_arrested = sum(arrested)/n() *100
  )|>
  arrange(percent_arrested)

```

## Make a bar graph

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
# hint

**hint:** pipe `|>` the data_frame above into `ggplot()` choose `x= race`, `y= percent_arrested` for your aesthetics. The pipe that into `geom_col()`. Add `+theme_minimal()` to make it clean.  
:::


```{r plot}

sqf_2021 |>
  select(SUSPECT_SEX, SUSPECT_RACE_DESCRIPTION, SUSPECT_REPORTED_AGE, SUSPECT_ARRESTED_FLAG)|>
  rename("sex" = "SUSPECT_SEX",
         "race" = "SUSPECT_RACE_DESCRIPTION",
         "age" = "SUSPECT_REPORTED_AGE",
         "arrested" = "SUSPECT_ARRESTED_FLAG") |>
  group_by(race) |>
  summarise(stops_by_race = n(),
            percent_stopped = n() / total_stops *100,
            percent_arrested = sum(arrested)/n() *100
  )|>
  arrange(percent_arrested)|>
  
# Make the graph below. The information is being piped from the datafram above. 
  ggplot(aes(x=race,y=percent_arrested)) +
  geom_col()+
  theme_minimal()

```
## Extra 2: Add a bar that shows the percent stopped

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
# hint

**hint:** Add another `geom_col()` with appropriate aesthetics. In my code I also gave the graphs color and nudged them a bit to the left or right.  
:::




```{r plot_extra2}

sqf_2021 |>
  select(SUSPECT_SEX, SUSPECT_RACE_DESCRIPTION, SUSPECT_REPORTED_AGE, SUSPECT_ARRESTED_FLAG)|>
  rename("sex" = "SUSPECT_SEX",
         "race" = "SUSPECT_RACE_DESCRIPTION",
         "age" = "SUSPECT_REPORTED_AGE",
         "arrested" = "SUSPECT_ARRESTED_FLAG") |>
  group_by(race) |>
  summarise(stops_by_race = n(),
            percent_stopped = n() / total_stops *100,
            percent_arrested = sum(arrested)/n() *100
  )|>
  arrange(percent_arrested)|>
  
# Make the graph below. The information is being piped from the datafram above. 
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x=race,y=percent_arrested), alpha = 0.5,  fill="blue", width = 0.25, position = position_nudge(x=0.15))+
  geom_col(aes(x=race,y=percent_stopped),alpha=0.5,fill="red",width = 0.25, position = position_nudge(x=-0.15))+
  theme_minimal()

```

## Extra 3: Add titles, axis labels, and a caption. Also add some text to the black bar for context. 

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
# hint

**hint:** Use the `labs()` function for this.  
:::




```{r plot_extra3}

sqf_2021 |>
  select(SUSPECT_SEX, SUSPECT_RACE_DESCRIPTION, SUSPECT_REPORTED_AGE, SUSPECT_ARRESTED_FLAG)|>
  rename("sex" = "SUSPECT_SEX",
         "race" = "SUSPECT_RACE_DESCRIPTION",
         "age" = "SUSPECT_REPORTED_AGE",
         "arrested" = "SUSPECT_ARRESTED_FLAG") |>
  group_by(race) |>
  summarise(stops_by_race = n(),
            percent_stopped = n() / total_stops *100,
            percent_arrested = sum(arrested)/n() *100
  )|>
  arrange(percent_arrested)|>
  
# Make the graph below. The information is being piped from the datafram above. 
  ggplot()+
  geom_col(aes(x=race,y=percent_arrested),   fill="blue", width = 0.25, position = position_nudge(x=0.15))+
  geom_col(aes(x=race,y=percent_stopped), fill="red",width = 0.25, position = position_nudge(x=-0.15))+
  labs(
        y="", 
       title = "Percent Stopped and Percent Arrested", 
       caption = "The red bars show the percent of people stopped of the total. The blue bars show the percent arrested of each race.")+
  theme_minimal()

```
