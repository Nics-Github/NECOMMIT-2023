# Introduction

-   Nic Schwab

-   SDS department at Smith

-   Math department at Holyoke Community College

-   Developing a Data Science Program at HCC

-   nschwab\@smith.edu

# Why Data Science?

-   Math teachers will be the ones teaching data science.

-   Data Science lends itself to inquiry practices and active learning.

# Why R?

Lots of resources available to learn R.

[Resources](sources/resources.qmd)

Many alternatives

# Stop, Question, Frisk

-   Started in the 1990s

-   New York City Police Practice

    -   Police need "[reasonable suspicion](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/392/1/)."

-   Targeting of Black and Latino young men.

-   Leads to mistrust in the police by these groups.

# More about about me

I'm not Black.

I am Hispanic.

I look White.

I am not from New York City.

In this data analysis I will have limited perspective.

# Race Exists

Let's acknowledge that the construct of race exists and plays a part in the way human being interact with each other.

# Schedule

::: incremental
1.  Introduce you to the data.

2.  Pose a question.

3.  Give you [data frames]{.underline} with data to answer the question one way.

    i.  You'll order them with a partner.

    ii. You'll make up [pseudocode]{.underline} to explain data transformations.

    iii. I'll give you the real code.

4.  We'll repeat the process of for 2021 data in R.

# Questions so far?

# The Data

[Here is](https://www.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/reports-analysis/stopfrisk.page) NYC's stop and frisk data.

Let's consider 2011 data

::: nonincremental
-   Each column is a variable

-   and each row is a stop
:::

*The variable names are inconsistent across years.*

# SQF History

```{r stop-frisk-years}
#| echo: TRUE
#| warning: FALSE
#| include: FALSE

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
options(scipen = 10)



```

```{r }
#| eval: False

# Read in each csv file. This is a lot 

# With purr csv

file_paths_csv <- fs::dir_ls("../data/2003_2015_csv_files")

file_contents_csv<- file_paths_csv |>
  map(function (path){
    read_csv(path)

file_contents_xl<- file_paths_xl |>
  map(function (path){
    read_excel(path)
  })

# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An1bUIg-nVM

#See the number of rows i.e stops in each year

# Questions

> ::: incremental
> 1.  Which racial groups were most likely to be stopped by police officers in 2011?
>
> 2.  What percent of the stops resulted in an arrest by race in 2011?
>
> 3.  How do the answers to these questions change in 2021?
>
> 4.  You will likely have more questions as we analyze the data.

# Your data frames

1.  Little envelopes **Data 2011**

-   Put the data frames in order.

-   Be sure you can explain the process from one df to another psuedocode

-   Questions about the data?

2.  Little envelope **functions**

-   After the frames are in order put the code arrows between each frame.
-   Questions about the code?
