# Resources for learning R for undergrads

Below are a list of resources which I have found useful. Please feel free to ask me about any of these or share ones you know about.  

# Data Science 

[Modern Dive](https://moderndive.com/)

  - This book has both basic data analysis and statistics. Its got nice examples but there aren't many homework problems. 
  
[Modern Data Science with R](https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr3e/)

  - This book is a complete data science and statistics text with R. Many good problems, especially if you like baseball.
  
[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html)

  - I find this to be a great reference manual.

# Statistics

[Project Mosaic](https://www.mosaic-web.org/)

  - The mosaic package was made by faculty to offer a bridge into R via statistics. I have taught with it many times in introductory statistics. 

  - [Statistical Modeling: A Fresh Approach by Daniel Kaplan](https://dtkaplan.github.io/SM2-bookdown/)
  
    - I have not used this text, but it has a booklet on R to acompany it. 
  
  - [A Studentâ€™s Guide to R](https://github.com/ProjectMOSAIC/LittleBooks/raw/master/StudentGuide/MOSAIC-StudentGuide.pdf)
  
      - This is a helpful resource to learning what functions in the mosaic package do. 
  
  - [R tutorials](https://github.com/Nics-Github/MTH142Rtutorials)
    
      - I made some learnr tutorials to show how to use the mosaic package with for Intro stats. The examples come from [OpenIntroStats 4th edition](https://www.openintro.org/book/os/). They are beta, if you want to collaborate on them let me know. 
      
[Introduction to Modern Statistics](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/)  

  - This book uses [infer](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2021/08/infer-1-0-0/#getting-to-know-infer) which is a more professional tool than mosaic.
  
  - I am currently teaching with this text. [website](https://nics-github.github.io/sds220/) 

# Programming

[Hands on programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/)

  - This is the next text I plan to read through. Its been recommended several times.
