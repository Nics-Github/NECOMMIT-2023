# Wrangling Functions

All functions come the dplyr which is loaded with the tidyverse. There are many more functions. See the [cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)

| function    | does                                          |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| select()    | selects columns from df                       |
| group_by()  | groups levels of a column for later functions |
| summarise() | preforms summary operations.                  |
| rename()    | renames the levels of a column.               |

# Graphing Functions

`ggplot2` handles graphing, it is loaded with the tidyverse. [cheatsheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/data-visualization.html?_gl=1*1exy8c6*_ga*MTY5NTk3OTI4Mi4xNjk0NTM1MDIy*_ga_2C0WZ1JHG0*MTY5NzU2NDA5MS41LjEuMTY5NzU2NDEyMS4wLjAuMA..)

| function        | does                                  |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------|
| ggplot()        | setsup a plot, needs df and aes()     |
| geom_col()      | makes column graphs based on aes(x,y) |
| labs()          | adds labels to graphs.                |
| theme_minimal() | A theme to clean things up            |

# Operators

| symbol | name                 | operation                                              |
|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------|

| \|\>   | pipe                 | moves an object into the first argument of a function. |
| \$     | dollar sign operator | Accesses one variable in a dataset.                    |
